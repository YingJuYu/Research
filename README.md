This paper discuss the rotational energy barriers in ferroelectric PVDF-related polymers. 
A polymer is a long, chain-like molecule built from smaller components called monomers. Each of monomer is composed of different atoms:
Hydrogen, Fluorine, Carbon, and Chlorine in the ferroelectric PVDF-related polymers. For example, a P(VDF-TrFE-CFE) polymer consists of three types of monomers: VDF, TrFE, and CFE units. Each of them rotate differently under electric field application, and the rotational
energy barriers are the energy required for the monomers rotate. The smaller the rotational energy barriers, the easier it is for the monomers to rotate, therefore, yields a better Electrocaloric cooling performance.

This work explored the rotational energy barriers of PVDF-related polymers using nudge
elastic band method with molecular force field simulations. This computational scheme
developed in the work yields a significant shorter time as compared to expensive density
functional theory simulations, and the number of polymer chains that can be included is much
higher than in density functional theory simulations which only include a couple single
polymer chains. A parametric studies on the chemical compositions of the P(VDFTrFE-CFE) polymers crystals is carried out which becomes a useful reference when synthesizing this polymer material.
